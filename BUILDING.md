NOTE:
- Building for Windows is only tested and recommended with Visual Studio 2022! These instructions for building with VSCode or the command line might not work!
- Every `.cpp` file that gets added to the project must be added to the `target_sources()` command in the top-level [CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) to be considered for compilation. Visual Studio might be able to do that semi-automatically, but double check it!
- Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 or later is recommended as it makes CMake project manipulation available. (Automatic target and source file adding, removing, and renaming in the CMake project without manually editing the CMake scripts)

## <ins>STEP 1: Downloading the repository's contents</ins>

Depending on your situation, downloading the entire repo requires different steps with varying effort.

### CASE 1
Clone the repository recursively with
```
git clone https://github.com/lacyyy/DZSimulator.git --recursive
```

### CASE 2
If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, you can get the missing submodules with
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### CASE 3
If for some reason, you need to build this repo and it has empty submodule folders and no Git history (which is what you get when selecting "Download ZIP" or the default "Download Source code" on GitHub's releases page), you need to add the submodules manually!

1. Delete all empty folders inside `thirdparty/`, the next steps will fail otherwise. Deleting the top-level `.gitmodules` file too is recommended. 
1. In the repo folder (where `docs/`, `res/`, `src/` and `thirdparty/` reside), run:
    ```
    git init
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Added non-submodule DZSimulator files"
    ```

1. Next, run these commands without changing the working directory to get the required submodules at specific versions (You can ignore the 'detached HEAD' advice): 
    ```
    git submodule add https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio.git thirdparty/asio/
    git submodule add https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3.git thirdparty/bullet/
    git submodule add https://github.com/mosra/corrade.git thirdparty/corrade/
    git submodule add https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git thirdparty/imgui/
    git submodule add https://github.com/mosra/magnum.git thirdparty/magnum/
    git submodule add https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration.git thirdparty/magnum-integration/
    git submodule add https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins.git thirdparty/magnum-plugins/
    git submodule add https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git thirdparty/SDL/
    git -C thirdparty/asio/ checkout asio-1-23-0
    git -C thirdparty/bullet/ checkout 2.83.7
    git -C thirdparty/corrade/ checkout f6eef8a2d4e151693dbf35621876ec074a8b7003
    git -C thirdparty/imgui/ checkout v1.88
    git -C thirdparty/magnum/ checkout 9c4f2ceea279dc9bdc17a55ef565136f602c9ac3
    git -C thirdparty/magnum-integration/ checkout 79747545dbe711055f7f06bcf6ac5c76541ab6c0
    git -C thirdparty/magnum-plugins/ checkout 03c597c7b2098326e472af62702b6d09beaf67c7
    git -C thirdparty/SDL/ checkout release-2.0.22
    ```
1. Check if the newly installed submodules have the right version by running `git submodule status`. The library versions are correct if you see the following hash values for each one:
    ```
    53dea9830964eee8b5c2a7ee0a65d6e268dc78a1 thirdparty/SDL (release-2.0.22)
    4915cfd8a1653c157a1480162ae5601318553eb8 thirdparty/asio (asio-1-23-0)
    2fb92bc40c16e4da5a9018479d4a8e1899702ab8 thirdparty/bullet (2.83.7)
    f6eef8a2d4e151693dbf35621876ec074a8b7003 thirdparty/corrade (v2020.06-847-gf6eef8a2)
    9aae45eb4a05a5a1f96be1ef37eb503a12ceb889 thirdparty/imgui (v1.62-2483-g9aae45eb)
    9c4f2ceea279dc9bdc17a55ef565136f602c9ac3 thirdparty/magnum (v2020.06-1597-g9c4f2ceea)
    79747545dbe711055f7f06bcf6ac5c76541ab6c0 thirdparty/magnum-integration (v2020.06-142-g7974754)
    03c597c7b2098326e472af62702b6d09beaf67c7 thirdparty/magnum-plugins (v2020.06-843-g03c597c7)
    ```

1. Then commit these submodules into Git:
    ```
    git add -A
    git commit -m "Added submodule DZSimulator files"
    ```


## <ins>STEP 2: Building the application</ins>

NOTE: Build instructions of option 2 and 3 sometimes didn't work, perhaps installing Visual Studio with choosing the "Desktop development with C++" workload is always required...

### OPTION 1 (RECOMMENDED): **Building with Visual Studio**
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer is recommended, Visual Studio 2019 might work too with CMake folder projects
- Choose "Open a local folder" or File > Open > Folder and select the repo folder (where `docs/`, `res/`, `src/` and `thirdparty/` reside)
- Make sure CMake presets are used in Visual Studio by setting: Tools > Options > CMake > General > "Prefer using CMake presets" or "Always use CMakePresets.json" or "Use CMake Presets if available"
    - Then close and reopen the repo folder in Visual Studio to activate the integration
- Select the desired CMake configure preset (e.g. "Windows x64 Debug" or "Windows x64 Release") in the toolbar
- Wait for CMake to finish configuring
- Right-click `src/main.cpp` and select "Set as Startup Item"
- Press Ctrl+B to build

### OPTION 2: **Building with Visual Studio Code**

1. Install VSCode
1. Install the C/C++ extension for VS Code, also install the CMake and CMake Tools extension
1. Download the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022). When you run the downloaded executable, it updates and runs the Visual Studio Installer. To install only the tools you need for C++ development, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
1. Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" from your recently installed Visual Studio tools to build 64-bit code (You can just enter the prompt into Windows search to find it)
1. In that command prompt, change directory to the DZSimulator repo folder (where `docs/`, `res/`, `src/` and `thirdparty/` reside)
1. Run `code .` to open VSCode in that directory
1. In VSCode, select a configure preset (e.g. "Windows x64 Debug" or "Windows x64 Release")
1. In VSCode, build the default build preset and wait for compilation to finish
1. In VSCode, select launch target "DZSimulator.exe" and launch it

### OPTION 3: **Building from the command line** ([CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.20 is required)

1. Download the [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022). When you run the downloaded executable, it updates and runs the Visual Studio Installer. To install only the tools you need for C++ development, select the "Desktop development with C++" workload.
1. Open "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt" from your recently installed Visual Studio tools to build 64-bit code (You can just enter the prompt into Windows search to find it)
1. In that command prompt, change directory to the DZSimulator repo folder (where `docs/`, `res/`, `src/` and `thirdparty/` reside)
1. Check available presets with
    ```
    cmake --list-presets=all
    ```
1. Generate project files (Choose command with your desired preset):
    ```
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 --preset win-x64-debug
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 --preset win-x64-release-static
    cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64 --preset win-x64-release-static-debuggable
    ```
1. Build (Choose command with your desired preset):
    ```
    cmake --build out/build/win-x64-debug --parallel --config Debug
    cmake --build out/build/win-x64-release-static --parallel --config Release
    cmake --build out/build/win-x64-release-static-debuggable --parallel --config RelWithDebInfo	
    ```
1. Run the binary (Choose command with your desired preset):
    ```
    out\build\win-x64-debug\Debug\bin\DZSimulator.exe
    out\build\win-x64-release-static\Release\bin\DZSimulator.exe
    out\build\win-x64-release-static-debuggable\Release\bin\DZSimulator.exe
    ```
